To execute the project use the following command:

java -jar DistributedFS.jar

The problem consists of users and servers. 
We have to manage wich server will provide the files to the users (more in enunciado.pdf).
The code is in the DistributedFS folder.

When the experiment is finished, the program will close and will create a folder called "\data that 
contains a text file with the result of the experiment.
